Inventory management is a web application that provides a common platform for Outlet owners, Merchants and Hauling Companies to manage, track and automate the inventory process. It has three main modules:

1.	Outlets: Outlet owner corresponding to a particular outlet can login to the application to create orders, track sales and view reports.
2.	Hauling companies: Owner belonging to a particular hauling company can view the orders received and update the status to various options like ‘Delivered’,’In Progress’ etc.
3.	Merchants: Merchant owner can also login to the application to view the orders received and update its status accordingly.
